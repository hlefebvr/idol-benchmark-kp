This code contains the code for benchmarking idol's Branch-and-Bound implementation.
Currently, the comparison is done between [idol (C++ library)](https://github.com/hlefebvr/idol) and [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/). 

The external solver used to solve continuous relaxations is [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/).
