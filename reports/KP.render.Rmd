## About

This page contains an automatic benchmark for the C++ library [idol](https://github.com/hlefebvr/idol)
to test its implementation of the [Branch-and-Bound algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) for solving instances of the [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

The results presented here are automatically generated using GitHub Actions and R with Rmarkdown. Note that the experiments themselves are run with GitHub Actions for which the code
is fully public and can be found [here for implementation details](https://github.com/hlefebvr/idol-benchmark-kp) and [here for GitHub Actions configuration](https://github.com/hlefebvr/idol-benchmark-kp/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml).

The experiments were conducted on a free GitHub-hosted runner with an `ubuntu-latest` virtual machine with two CPU cores (x86_64), 7 GB of RAM and 14 GB of SSD space (see [hardware specifications here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)).

Last automatic run: `r format(Sys.time(), '%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S')`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  out.width = "100%"
)

```

## Mathematical models

Let us consider a set of $n$ items. Each item $i$ has a profit $p_i$ which is earned if the item is selected and a weight $w_i$. The knapsack capacity is noted $W$.

$$
  \begin{array}{lll}
    \max \ & \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j \\
    \textrm{s.t.} \ & \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j \le W \\
    & x_{j} \in \{ 0,1 \} \quad j=1,...,n.
  \end{array}
$$
Here, variable $x_{j}$ equals 1, if and only if, item $i$ is selected in the knapsack. 

## Reading instances

In this section, we start by reading the raw computational results stored in CSV files. Note that these CSV files is stored as an *artifact* on the [GitHub Actions of the hlefebvr/idol-benchmark-kp repository](https://github.com/hlefebvr/idol-benchmark-kp/actions) and can be downloaded without restrictions by clicking on the latest workflow execution named `benchmark` under the section "Artifacts" (also note that artifacts have a life span of 90 days).


```{r}
time_limit = 5 * 60
```


### Reading the results

We first start to read results obtained using idol, which can be found inside the `results_GAP_idol.csv` file (Note that this file can be obtained by running `cat results_GAP_idol__*.csv > results_GAP_idol.csv` after having extracted the `.zip` the artifact).

```{r}
results = read.csv("../results_KP_idol.csv", header = FALSE)
colnames(results) = c("tag", "instance", "solver", "node_selection_rule", "branching_rule", "heuristic", "time", "n_nodes", "best_bound", "best_obj")

results$tag = NULL

if (sum(results$time > time_limit) > 0) {
  results[results$time > time_limit,] = time_limit
}

results$solver_with_params = paste0(results$solver, ", ", results$node_selection_rule, ",", results$branching_rule, ", ", results$heuristic)
results[results$solver == "external",]$solver_with_params = "external" 

paged_table(results)
```
